# LIHTC Location Scoring Tool

A comprehensive web application for calculating location-based scoring criteria for Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) applications in Georgia, based on the 2024-2025 Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP).

Created by **Emory's Center for AI**

## Overview

The LIHTC Location Scoring Tool automates the calculation of location-based criteria that comprise approximately 39% of the total LIHTC application scoring. The tool evaluates potential development sites across four main categories:

- **Desirable/Undesirable Activities** (Â±20 points)
- **Community Transportation Options** (6 points)
- **Quality Education Areas** (3 points)
- **Stable Communities** (10 points)
